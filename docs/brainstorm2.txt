Big question: 
first principal: I want to use the app online (70%) and offiline (30% like on plane)
can it be done at phone system level so that it won't necessary synce and call sportify api all the time every few second
chanllenges are : connection and fetech play info from sportify app; also data management (local - database)


Goal: 

short time
- online sportify show play episode name and maybe cover image and pod author (i think the timestamp is correct now so i don't think time need to display)
- sportify auth (if i have to sync with sportify all the time, not sync at my phone operatoing system level)


long term
- Offline capability same as what the app do with network (can call sportify api)
- UI upgrade pixel nintendo game type of UI and font
- pixel double tap and pixel bud long press shortcut intergration
- my bookmark better display and able to edit and delete


long long term:
- android phone but able to use / choose shortcut from other earbud or headset
- iphone with airpod
- iphone witn other type of earbud
- bookmark with AI for summary

maybe more idea to make this app lightwight more flexible more user interact friendly less configure get one thing done and done well.
